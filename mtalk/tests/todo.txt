Make diagnostic commands available to "authorized" users.

One such command is return list of users currently using mtalk.

"mtcheck" and "mtnotify" will first connect to this new service
of mtalk to see if a "recipient" is already connected.  If mtalk
refuses the connection, immediate exit of 1 (not present), if a
recipient is found, immediate exit of 0 (present), else continue
with normal ("as-is") processing.
