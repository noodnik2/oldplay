CHKOUT(C1)		USER ENHANCEMENT COMMANDS		CHKOUT(C1)


NAME

	chkout - check out a device or file


SYNOPSIS

	chkout -c [-u <user>] [-g <group>] [-m <mode>] <dev> [<dev> ...]
	chkout -r <dev> [<dev> ...]
	chkout -l [{ all | avail | busy | inuse }]
	chkout -q <dev> [<dev>...]
	chkout


USAGE

	Use the chkout command to make a system device or resource-file
	available for exlusive use by a user or group of users.

	The -c option checks out a resource file to a user or group; the
	owner of the device or file is changed to <user>, the group is
	changed to <group>, and the permissions are changed to <mode>.
	When the <user> and <group> values are not specified, the current
	values are taken from the user issuing the chkout command.  The
	<mode> value defaults to read, write, and execute permission for
	the designated user, the temporary owner of the resource (700).

	The -r option returns the resource to its default owner and group,
	with the default access permissions.

	The -l option reports the current status of all resources.

	The -q option reports the checked-out status of specified resources.

	Without any arguments, the chkout command prints a short usage
	diagram.

	A list of resource-files available for checking out is contained
	in the file ${LCLBIN}/chkout.res.  The format of this file is:

	  <dev> <owner> <group> <default mode> <access group(s)>

	One entry per line, each field separated by white space.

	<dev>, <owner>, and <group> must be specified explicitly, while
	<default mode> may be specified in any valid chmod(1) format.
	If the field <access group(s)> is present, it lists the groups
	to which users must belong in order to be allowed to chkout the
	specified resource.  The file /etc/groups is scanned to determine
	access rights according to <access group(s)>.  Each group-id
	specified in <access group(s)> is separated by a comma.

	The list of currently checked-out resources is kept in the file
	${LCLBIN}/chkout.status whose format is:

	  <dev> <by_user> <time_out>

	The <by_user> value is the user that issued the chkout command
	resulting in the checkout of the resource, and the <time_out>
	field indicates the time and date that the resource was checked
	out.  This enables the -q command to publish who forgot to re-
	turn a checked-out resource, and how guilty that person is.  To
	whom the resource is checked out, etc, can be revealed by using
	the "ls -l" command on the resource file itself.


NOTES

	Note that the angle brackets are used only for diagrammatic pur-
	poses, and are not entered as part of each field.
