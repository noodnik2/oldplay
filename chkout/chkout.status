;	This is the checkout file, containing the status of each
;	currently checked out device.
;
;	The file format is the same as that of the resource file
;	so far as header lines and the ID line are concerned, ex-
;	cept that the ID value is "status", not "resource".
;
;	The data lines consist of three values: the first two of
;	which are words separated by white space.  The third value
;	is a time-stamp which may contain spaces.
