	RE:	flist source directory

	The files in this directory comprise the flist program.
	
	To compile the modules here, use the makefile provided.

	To reinstall everything from scratch, type the following
	(assuming you are currently in this directory):
	
		$ setenv DESTDIR /usr/local/bin
		$ make clean
		$ make install

	Note that the DESTDIR you are setting is where everything
	will be "installed".  Set this to "." if you want to test
	the code before making it public. 

	Or, you can "make" and install an individual component.  The
	components are:

		flist			The flist program
		flistmc			The configuration utility
		flmac.prog		The configuration compiler
		flist.man1		The flist manual

	To make (compile and link) flist, for example, type:

		$ make flist

	To install (copy to $DESTDIR and make public) a component
	such as flist.man1 for example, type:

		$ make install_flist.man1

	Just add the string "install_" before the component name to
	install it.

	The command "make install" simply installs all components
	of flist.
		


	the dstring directory:
	----------------------

	the code in this directory is the original code brought
	in from another source (Stata/RGS) to support disk buf-
	fering of messages.  These subroutines are being used
	for storing the keyboard macros available in flist.

	The mkdstr.c source program contains the main routine
	for flmac.prog, the macro file compiler. e.g.

		cc -o flmac.prog mkdstr.c ...

	Again, this stuff is taken care of in the makefile.
