base object class:			Obj

	- defines global base object
	- defines several generic method pointer types


object pointer array class:		OPAry

	- derived from "Obj"
	- class managing list of pointers to objects derived from "Obj"
	- has methods for:
		a. adding items to list
		b. deleting an item from the list
		c. growing/shrinking the list size
		d. list traversal (returns "Obj *")
		e. finding an object in the list given compare method
		f. assignment operator, copy constructor
		g. inserting (from) another "OPAry" object


ordered object pointer array class:	OrdOPAry

	- derived from "OPAry"
	- constructor receives compare method defining sort order
	- overrides methods for:
		a. adding items to list (inserts objects in proper order)
		b. assignment operator, copy constructor
		c. inserting (from) another "OPAry" object
	- adds methods for:
		a. finding an object in the list with no compare method
		   (uses binary search)
		b. determining current sort order


sortable object pointer array class:	SrtOPAry

	- derived from "OPAry"
	- adds methods for:
		a. sorting items in list given compare method
		b. assignment operator, copy constructor
		c. determining current sort order
